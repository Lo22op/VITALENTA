## 📖 The Story

At a certain point in my front-end learning journey, I hit a wall.

I had learned a lot: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS... but theory wasn’t enough anymore.  
I needed something real — not a full-stack app, not a to-do list.  
Something small but meaningful.

So I decided to build a *restaurant*.  
Not a real one, of course...  
Just a website that tells a story — my story as a developer-in-training.

That’s how **VITALENTA** was born.
